                <h2>Basic HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and was created by Tim Berners-lee. This is used along with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Javascript to create web application. The current version of HTML is HTML5. You can begin an HTML page on your own by opening any text editor and following the steps below. Be sure to save the file with ".html" at the end of the name. Ex: index.html
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Structure">
                <header>Basic Structure</header><hr class="section-div" />
                <h2>Template</h2>
                <p>
                    To begin an HTML page you will need three different elements. These are html, head, and body. The html element is the container for everyting else. the head and body are both placed withing html but not within each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lthtml&gt <br />
                    &lthead&gt Metadata (non-visible content) &lt/head&gt <br />
                    &ltbody&gt <br /><br />Visible page content<br /><br /> &lt/body&gt <br />
                    &lt/html&gt
                </p>
                <h2>Elements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>&lthtml&gt &lt/html&gt</li>
                    <li>&lthead&gt &lt/head&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltbody&gt &lt/body&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltbr /&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltheader&gt &lt/header&gt</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A page in HTML is made up of nested elements. These elements, also called "tags", are enclosed in brackets. This is shown in the list above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general tags must be opened and closed as in the first three items in this list. However, some elements like &ltbr /&gt are empty or self-closing and so not need a seperate closing tag.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Adding_Text">
                <header>Adding Text</header><hr class="section-div" />
                <h2>Paragraph</h2>
                <p>
                    The way most text will be added to your page is with paragraph tags: &ltp&gt Your text here! &lt/p&gt
                </p>
                <h2>Headings</h2>
                <p>
                    You will want to add headings in your page to designate different sections of the page or new subjects. You have six headings at your disposal and they differ in size from &lth1&gt (largest) to &lth6&gt (smallest). The text "Adding Text" on this page is using the &lth1&gt tag and the text "Headings" is using the &lth2&gt element.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Other_Elements">
                <header>Other Elements</header><hr class="section-div" />
                <h2>Links</h2>
                <p>
                    You can add links to your page using the anchor element: &lta&gt &lt/a&gt. These will show up as blue text that turns purple when clicked on. You specify a destination for the link usging the attribute: href="example.html" and can open the page in a new tab with target="_blank"
                </p>
                <h2>New Lines</h2>
                <p>
                    You can begin a new line by using the &ltbr /&gt element. This will move the following text down a single line.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Viewing_Your_Website">
                <header>Viewing Your Website</header><hr class="section-div" />
                <h2>Viewing locally</h2>
                <p>
                    To view your new web page on your computer simply locate the file (saved with the .html extension!!) and double click on it. Your default web browser should pull up your page. You will likely want to continue on to a CSS tutorial to spice up the aesthetics of your page.
                </p>

                <h2>Viewing over the World Wide Web</h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to view your website online you will need to hire a web hosting provider and register a domain name (these can often be done seperately or together). The hosting provider will have seperate documentation explaining how to use their particular service. You will also want to look into CSS to make your page stand out and be easier to use for your visitors!
